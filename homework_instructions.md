* The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.
* Bonus: Program it to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
* **HINT**: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console.

## Submission Guide
